# 16S rRNA Sequence Processing
In this part of the book, we will dive into processing steps for 16S rRNA raw reads to obtain features such as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV). This steps will provide a detailed explanation and demonstrate the usage of relevant tools.


## Steps
We will basically follow the process depicted in the below diagram.
